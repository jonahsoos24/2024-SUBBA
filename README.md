# 2024 Syraucse Basketball Analytics Competition

Won both room and best overall presentation.
- Tasked with analyzing play sequences to evaluate shot creation and scoring
- Also examined the importance of actions, pace, and team systems.
Methodology:
- Utilized Sequence Graph Transformation (SGT) to quantify weak and strong relationships between play and zone types in a possession
- Condensed results using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Ran an optimized K-Means Clustering model to cluster plays into different groups.
- All was done using Python and Jupyter Notebook
Results:
- Used Points Per Possession and Shot Contest percentages to analyze each cluster
- Found that both Spacing and Read and React play style sequencing were the most efficient
- Offenses that heavily utilize Ball Screens and Isolation only work when a team has elite offensive players
- The most efficient play styles utilize drives and cuts early in the shot clock while using spaced shooting when time runs out.
